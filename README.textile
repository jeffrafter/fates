Fate Search is based on FTSearch by Mauricio Fernandez which can be
found at http://www.eigenclass.org/

Fate Search uses a suffix-array, so if you look for e.g. "fa", it'll match
faq, fat, fat_entry, ..., making it equivalent to looking for "fa*" with
Ferret.

Fate Search does phrasal search naturally, if you're lookup for "big array", 
just enter it (without the quotes); with ferret-lookup.rb, you *have* to
surround the phrase with quotes.

== TRY IT OUT ==
You can test things out using the rake tasks

  rake fates:index
  rake fates:search QUERY='Smith'
  rake fates:search QUERY='Smith' SORT=y

If you apply sorting the results will be sorted and ranked but the printing 
(tree navigation) will take considerably longer.

Note: currently merged (delta) indexes are not supported. Search allows you to 
look for names from the spec/samples/contacts.csv file. 

== TODO ==
Gemify this with Jeweler. Consider some native extensions (based on the FTSearch
native extensions). In general lots of profiling was done around the sorting
and  initial indexing but as always you can still optimize.

I originally built ActiveRecord extensions for fates, but have removed them as
they would need additional work.
