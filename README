Fate Search is based on FTSearch by Founded by Mauricio Fernandez which can be
found at http://www.eigenclass.org/

Note: Fate Search uses a suffix-array, so if you look for e.g. "fa", it'll match
faq, fat, fat_entry, ..., making it equivalent to looking for "fa*" with
Ferret.

Fate Search does phrasal search naturally, if you're lookup for "big array", just
enter it (without the quotes); with ferret-lookup.rb, you *have* to
surround the phrase with quotes.

TRY IT OUT
==========
git clone git://codeplot.com/fates.git
rake fates:index
rake fates:search QUERY='Smith'

Note: index builds the index, currently merged indexes are not supported. Search
allows you to look for names from the spec/samples/contacts.csv file.
